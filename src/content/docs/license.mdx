To futher support the future development of this library it is now available with both commercial and open source licensing.

## Commercial License

If you want to use _iframe-resizer_ on non open-sourced sites, themes, projects, and/or applications, the Commercial License is the appropriate license. With this option, your source code is kept proprietary. Which means, you won't have to change your whole application source code to an open source license.
