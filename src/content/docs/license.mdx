To better support the futher development of this library it is now available with both commercial and open source versions.

## Commercial license

If you want to use iframe-resizer to non open sourced sites, themes, projects, and applications, the Commercial license is the appropriate license. With this option, your source code is kept proprietary. Which means, you won't have to change your whole application source code to an open source license.

You will have to provide a prominent notice that iframe-resizer is in use. The credit comments in the JavaScript files should be kept intact (even after combination or minification).
