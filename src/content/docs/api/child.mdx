The Child API is for use on the page contained within the `<iframe>` tag. It is split into three sections. [Options](#options) contains settings that can be passed when calling iframe-resizer. [Events](#events) are trigged by updates to the iframe, or messages from the iframe. [Methods](#methods) allow you to interact with _iframe-resizer_ after the initial resizing.

<Aside type="note" title="">
  The features on this page are available in the Professional, Business and Open-source editions.
</Aside>

## Options

The following options can be set from within the iframe page by creating a `window.iframeResizer` object before the JavaScript file is loaded into the page.

```html
<script>
  window.iframeResizer = {
    targetOrigin: "http://mydomain.com",
  };
</script>
<script src="node_modules/@iframe-resizer/child/index.umd.js"></script>
```

### offset

```
default: 0
type:    integer
```

Modify the computed size of the iframe. This is useful if the page in the iframe returns a size value that is consitantly slightly different to how you want the iframe to be sized. This can be set to a positive or
negative value.


### targetOrigin

```
default: '*'
type: string
```

This option allows you to restrict the domain of the parent page, to prevent other sites mimicking your 
parent page. This option is really a last line of defense and you should also setup a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CSP" target="_blank">Content Security Policy</a> on your webserver.


## Events

The following events can be included in the [options](options.md) object attached to the iframed page.

### onMessage

    type: function (message)

Receive message posted from the parent page with the `iframe.iframeResizer.sendMessage()` method.

### onReady

    type: function()

This function is called once _iframe-resizer_ has been initialized after receiving a call from the parent page. If you need to call any of the following methods during page load, then they should be called from this event handler.

## Methods

These methods are available in the iframe via the `window.parentIframe` object. These method should be contained by a test for the `window.parentIframe` object, in case the page is not loaded inside an iframe. For example:

```js
if ("parentIframed" in window) {
  parentIframe.close();
}
```

### autoResize(<span class="args">bool</span>)

Turn autoResizing of the iframe on and off. Returns bool of current state.

### close()

Remove the iframe from the parent page.

### getId()

Returns the ID of the iframe that the page is contained in.

### getParentProperties(<span class="args">callback</span>)

Ask the containing page for its positioning coordinates. You need to provide a callback which receives an object with the following read only properties:

```js
{
  // iframe.getBoundingRect()
  iframe: {
    width
    height
    top
    right
    bottom
    left
  },

  // from document.documentElement
  document: {
    scrollWidth
    scrollHeight
  },

  // window.visualViewport
  viewport: {
    width
    height
    offsetLeft
    offsetTop
    pageLeft
    pageTop
    scale
  }
}
```

Your callback function will be recalled when the parent page is scrolled or resized.

This method returns a `disable()` function, that you can call to stop updates from
the parent page. The following example requests the properties from the parent page
and passes a callback that logs them to the console and then disables further updates.

```js
const disableParentProperties = 
  parentIframe.getParentProperties(parentProps) => {
    console.log('Parent Page Props', parentProps)
    disableParentProperties()
  })
```

### scrollTo(<span class="args">x, y</span>)

Scroll the parent page to the coordinates x and y.

### scrollToOffset(<span class="args">x, y</span>)

Scroll the parent page to the coordinates x and y relative to the position of the iframe.

### sendMessage(<span class="args">message, [targetOrigin]</span>)

Send data to the containing page, `message` can be any data type that can be serialized into JSON. The `targetOrigin` option is used to restrict where the message is sent to; to stop an attacker mimicking your parent page. See the MDN documentation on [postMessage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window.postMessage) for more details.

### resize()

Manually force iframe to resize. If for some reason a change in content size is not detected, this method allows you to nudge _iframe-resizer_ to recalculate the page size.
