The Parent API is for use on the page containing the `<iframe>` tag. It is split into three sections. [Options](#options) contains settings that can be passed when calling iframe-resizer. [Events](#events) are trigged by updates to the iframe, or messages from the iframe. [Methods](#methods) allow you to interact with _iframe-resizer_ after the initial resizing.

## Options

The following options can be passed to _iframe-resizer_ on the parent page.

### License

```
    type:    string
```

**Commercial** Enter the key provided with the [purchased](/pricing) commercial license.

**Open Source** If you are using _iframe-resizer_ on an open-source site or project, then you can use it for free under the terms of the [Gnu Public License V3](/gpl). To accept these terms set the license to `GPL-V3`.

### bodyBackground

```
    default: null
    type:    string
```

Override the body background style in the iFrame.

### bodyMargin

```
    default: null
    type:    string || number
```

Override the default body margin style in the iFrame. A string can be any valid value for the CSS margin attribute, for example '8px 3em'. A number value is converted into px.

### bodyPadding

```
    default: null
    type:    string || number
```

Override the default body padding style in the iFrame. A string can be any valid value for the CSS margin attribute, for example '8px 3em'. A number value is converted into px.

### checkOrigin

```
    default: true
    type:    boolean || array
```

When set to true, only allow incoming messages from the domain listed in the `src` property of the iFrame tag. If your iFrame navigates between different domains, ports or protocols; then you will need to provide an array of URLs or disable this option.

### direction

```
default: 'horizontal'
values: 'horizontal' || 'vertical' || 'none'
```

Set the direction in which you want the iframe to automaticaly scale to the content size.

import { Aside } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

<Aside type="tip" title="Horizontal Resizing">
  When setting the direction to `horizontal` it is best to avoid floating or
  positioning elements to the right side of the page, as this will interfer with
  working out the content width.

If you cmust have elements on the right of the page, then you will need to tell
_iframe-resizer_ which page element touse to calculated the width by adding a `data-iframe-size`
attribute.

</Aside>

### inPageLinks

```
    default: false
    type:    boolean
```

When enabled in page linking inside the iFrame and from the iFrame to the parent page will be enabled.

### offsetHeight

```
    default: 0
    type:    integer
```

Modify the computed height of the iframe. This is useful if the page in the iframe returns a height value that is consitantly slightly different to how you want the iframe to be sized.

<sup>\*</sup> This value can also be set on a per page basis in the iframe.

### offsetWidth

```
    default: 0
    type:    integer
```

Modify the computed width of the iframe. This is useful if the page in the iframe returns a width value that is consitantly slightly different to how you want the iframe to be sized.

<sup>\*</sup> This value can also be set on a per page basis in the iframe.

### scrolling

```
    default: false
    type:    boolean | 'omit'
```

Enable scroll bars in iFrame.

- **true** applies `scrolling="yes"`
- **false** applies `scrolling="no"`
- **'omit'** applies no `scrolling` attribute to the iFrame

### tolerance

```
    default: 0
    type:    integer
```

Set the number of pixels the iFrame content size has to change by, before triggering a resize of the iFrame.

### warningTimeout

```
    default: 5000
    type:    integer
```

Set the number of milliseconds after which a warning is logged if the iFrame has not responded. Set to `0` to supress warning messages of this type.

## Events

The following callback events can be passed to _iframe-resizer_ on the parent page, as part of the [options](options.md) object.

### onClose

```js
onClose: (iframeID) => boolean;
```

Called before the iFrame is closed via `parentIFrame.close()` or `iframe.iFrameResizer.close()` methods. Returning `false` will prevent the iFrame from closing.

### onClosed

```js
onClosed: (iframeID) => undefined;
```

Called after the iFrame is closed via `parentIFrame.close()` or `iframe.iFrameResizer.close()` methods.

### onMessage

```js
onMessage: ({ iframe, message }) => undefined;
```

Receives messages posted from the iFrame with the `parentIFrame.sendMessage()` method.

### onMouseEnter

```js
onMouseEnter: ({ iframe, height, width, type }) => undefined;
```

Function called after the mouse enters the iframe. Passes `messageData` object containing the **iFrame**, **screenX**, **screenY** and the **type** of event that triggered the callback.

### onMouseLeave

```js
onMouseLeave: ({ iframe, height, width, type }) => undefined;
```

Function called after the mouse leaves the iframe. Passes `messageData` object containing the **iFrame**, **screenX**, **screenY** and the **type** of event that triggered the callback.

### onReady

```js
onReady: (iframe) => undefined;
```

Called after initial setup.

### onResized

```js
onResized: ({ iframe, height, width, type }) => undefined;
```

Function called after iFrame resized. Passes `messageData` object containing the **iFrame**, **height**, **width** and the **type** of event that triggered the iFrame to resize.

### onScroll

```js
onScroll: ({ x, y }) => [true | false];
```

Called before the page is repositioned after a request from the iFrame, due to either an in page link, or a direct request from either [parentIFrame.scrollTo()](../child#scrolltoxy) or [parentIFrame.scrollToOffset()](../child#scrolltooffsetxy). If this function returns **false**, it will stop the library from repositioning the page, so that you can implement your own custom animated page scrolling instead.

## Methods

Once the iFrame has been initialized, an `iframeResizer` object is bound to it. This has the following methods available.

### close()

Remove the iFrame from the page. You should call this method, rather than using JavaScript to remove an iframe directly from the page.

### disconnect()

Disconnect _iframe-resizer_ from the iFrame. This is option allows Virtual DOMs to remove an iFrame tag. It should not normally be required.

### moveToAnchor(anchor)

Move to anchor in the iFrame.

### resize()

Tell the iFrame to resize itself.

### sendMessage(message, [targetOrigin])

Send data to the containing page, `message` can be any data type that can be serialized into JSON. The `targetOrigin` option is used to restrict where the message is sent to, in case your iFrame navigates away to another domain.
