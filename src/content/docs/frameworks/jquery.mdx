import Install from "../../../components/Install.astro";
import License from "../../../components/License.astro";

## Install

Install this package with the following command.

<Install package="@iframe-resizer/jquery" />

You will also need to ensure that the [@iframe-resizer/child](../../setup/#child-page-setup) package has been loaded into the iframe.

## Usage

Use jQuery to find the iframes on the page and then pass them to the `iframeResize()` method. The plugin will automatically filter out any non-iframe elements returned by jQuery.

```js
<script src="node_modules/jquery/jquery.js"></script>
<script src="node_modules/iframe-resizer/jquery/index.umd.js"></script>
<script>
  $("iframe").iframeResize({ license: 'xxxx' });
</script>
```

You can pass any of the standard Parent API [options](/api/parent#options) and [events](/api/parent#events) via this plugin.

<License />

## Child page

You will then need to install the [@iframe-rsizer/child](../../getting_started/#child-page-setup) package on the page in the iframe.
