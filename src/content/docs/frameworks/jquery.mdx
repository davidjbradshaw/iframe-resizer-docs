## Install

Download and install this package with one of the following options.

<Install package="@iframe-resizer/jquery" cdn download />

You will also need to ensure that the [@iframe-resizer/child](/setup#child-page-setup) package has been loaded into the iframe.

## Usage

Use jQuery to find the iframes on the page and then pass them to the `iframeResize()` method. The plugin will automatically filter out any non-iframe elements returned by jQuery.

```js
<script src="/node_modules/jquery/jquery.js"></script>
<script src="/node_modules/iframe-resizer/jquery/index.umd.js"></script>
<script>
  $('iframe').iframeResize({ license: 'xxxx' });
</script>
```

You can pass any of the standard Parent API [options](/api/parent#options) and [events](/api/parent#events) via this plugin.

<License />

## Child page

You will then need to install the [@iframe-resizer/child](/setup#child-page-setup) package on the page in the iframe.

Once everything is setup, keep an eye on the [browser console](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/Tools_and_setup/What_are_browser_developer_tools),
as _iframe-resizer_ will warn about any potential issues it detects and provide advice 
on how to fix them. For more details on using _iframe-resizer_ see the 
[Performance](/performance) and [Trouble Shooting](/troubleshooting) sections 
of this guide.
