The [Google Apps Script](https://www.google.com/script/start/) platform creates a nested
iframe between your app and the page it is host on. This creates a unique challenge for
_iframe-resizer_, as it needs to be able to talk directly with the iframe it is using to
calculate the page size from.

This can be overcome by providing _iframe-resizer_ some hints on where it can fimd the nested iframe, in order to establlish communication between the parent page and the GAS iframe.

### Child Page

The first step is to add the following line of code into your GAS application. This will
send a message to the parent page when your application loads that contains details of where
the iframe is located.

```html
top.postMessage('gasFrame', '*')
```

You will also need to install the [@iframe-resizer/child](../../setup/#child-page-setup)
package to your GAS application.

### Parent Page

The parent page needs to wait to recieve the above message before starting _iframe-resizer_.
Once it has recieved the contained referrences from the GAS application iframe, these can then 
be passed along to _iframe-resizer_ as follows.

```js
window.addEventListener(
  "message",
  (event) => {
    if (event.data === "gasFrame") {
      iframeResize(
        {
          checkOrigin: event.origin,
          offsetHeight: 19,
          license: "xxxx",
          postMessageTarget: event.source,
        },
        "#myGasIframe"
      );
    }
  },
  false
);
```

The value for `offsetHeight` may need to be adjusted based on the content of your GAS application.

Once everyting is setup, keep an eye on the [browser console](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/Tools_and_setup/What_are_browser_developer_tools),
as _ifrane-resizer_ will warn about any potential issues it detects and provide advice 
on how to fix them. For more details on using _iframe-resizer_ see the 
[Performace](../../performace) and [Trouble Shooting](../../troubleshooting) sections 
of this guide.
