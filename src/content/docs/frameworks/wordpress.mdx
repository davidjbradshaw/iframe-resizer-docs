The _iframe-resizer_ project is comprised of seporate JS files for the parent and child pages.
This guide takes you through setting up the parent and then child pages.

## Parent Page

In this section we detail how to setup the parent page.

### Download Parent JS

Download the file [iframe-resizer.parent.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/davidjbradshaw/iframe-resizer/master/js/iframe-resizer.parent.js)
and then upload it into the `/wp-admin/js` folder in WordPress.

###

{/* <!-- prettier-ignore-start --> */}

```html
<style>
  iframe {
    width: 100%;
    height: 100vh;
  }
</style>

<iframe id="myIframe" src="http://anotherdomain.com/iframe.html"></iframe>

<script src="/wp-admin/js/iframe-resizer.parent.js"></script>
<script>
  iframeResize({ license: "xxxx" });
</script>
```

{/* <!-- prettier-ignore-end --> */}

Setting the initial height of the iframe to `100vh` makes the loading in of
the iframe appear smoother to the user, as they will only see the content
below the iframe once it has completed loading and undergone it's initial
sizing.

## Child Page

The child page needs to load it's own JavaScript package, to enable communication
with the parent page. This is a small self-contained script with no dependancies.
It is designed to be a good guest on someone else site and will only start running
after recieving a message from the parent page.

### Download Parent JS

Download the file [iframe-resizer.child.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/davidjbradshaw/iframe-resizer/master/js/iframe-resizer.child.js)
and then upload it into the `/wp-admin/js` folder in WordPress.

### Usage

The following line then needs to be added to every shown in the iframe.

```html
<script src="/wp-admin/js/iframe-resizer.child.js"></script>
```

Once everting is setup, keep an eye on the browser console, as _ifrane-resizer_
will warn about any potential issues it detects and provide advice on how to fix them.
